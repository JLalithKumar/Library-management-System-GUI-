# Library Management System GUI

A desktop application built with **Java Swing** to manage library operations like book inventory, members, and issue/return processes.

## Objective
To build a Java program that allows administrators to **manage books and members efficiently**, providing a user-friendly interface for library management.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Java** (Programming Language)  
- **Swing** (GUI Framework)  
- **MySQL** (Database)  
- **JDBC** (Database Connectivity)  
- **IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code** (IDE)

- **Database Integration** – MySQL tables store books, members, and transaction records.  
- **JDBC Connectivity** – Executes CRUD operations between Java and MySQL.  
- **Organized Code** – Separate classes for login, book management, member management, and transactions.  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming, GUI development, and database integration in Java**. It provides a structured system for library management with persistent storage and an interactive interface.
